# Checkout Process Optimization Project
# Overview:
Welcome to the Checkout Process Optimization project repository! In this project, we aim to enhance the user experience on the 365 webpage by optimizing the checkout flow. By analyzing key metrics and insights, we will build a comprehensive Tableau dashboard for the period from 07-01-2022 to 01-31-2023. The dashboard will provide a visual representation of the checkout process, focusing on successful checkouts, failed checkouts, and abandoned carts.

# Objective:
The primary goal is to develop a strategy to improve the checkout process and enhance the user payment experience. To achieve this, we will:

# Analyze Checkout Metrics:

- Monthly Checkout Success Rate: Evaluate the efficiency of the checkout process.
- Monthly Cart Abandonment Rate: Identify potential issues hindering the purchase.
- Most Common Checkout Errors and Device Correlations: Discover patterns in checkout errors and their correlation with devices.
  
# SQL Code:
The provided SQL code sets the foundation for the analysis. It covers the following steps:

- Initialize CTE for All Created Carts: total_carts_created
- Select Data on Checkout Attempts: total_checkout_attempts
- Temporary Result Set for Successful Checkout Attempts: total_successful_attempts
- Count Total Number of Carts Daily: count_total_carts
- Count Total Daily Checkout Attempts: count_total_checkout_attempts
- Count Only Successful Daily Attempts: count_successful_checkout_attempts
- Construct Final Result Set: checkout_steps
- Additionally, a new table called checkout_errors is created to capture relevant data on checkout errors.

# Instructions:
Execute the SQL code in your database environment to obtain the necessary data.
Utilize the output to build a Tableau dashboard.
Analyze the dashboard to draw conclusions and identify potential enhancements to the checkout process.
