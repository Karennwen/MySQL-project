# Checkout Process Optimization Project
# Overview:
Welcome to the Checkout Process Optimization project repository! In this project, we aim to enhance the user experience on the 365 webpage by optimizing the checkout flow. By analyzing key metrics and insights, we will build a comprehensive Tableau dashboard for the period from 07-01-2022 to 01-31-2023. The dashboard will provide a visual representation of the checkout process, focusing on successful checkouts, failed checkouts, and abandoned carts.

# Objective:
The primary goal is to develop a strategy to improve the checkout process and enhance the user payment experience. To achieve this, we will:

# Analyze Checkout Metrics:

- Monthly Checkout Success Rate: Evaluate the efficiency of the checkout process.
- Monthly Cart Abandonment Rate: Identify potential issues hindering the purchase.
- Most Common Checkout Errors and Device Correlations: Discover patterns in checkout errors and their correlation with devices.
  
# SQL Code:
The provided SQL code sets the foundation for the analysis. It covers the following steps:

- Initialize CTE for All Created Carts: total_carts_created
- Select Data on Checkout Attempts: total_checkout_attempts
- Temporary Result Set for Successful Checkout Attempts: total_successful_attempts
- Count Total Number of Carts Daily: count_total_carts
- Count Total Daily Checkout Attempts: count_total_checkout_attempts
- Count Only Successful Daily Attempts: count_successful_checkout_attempts
- Construct Final Result Set: checkout_steps
- Additionally, a new table called checkout_errors is created to capture relevant data on checkout errors.

# Instructions:
Execute the SQL code in your database environment to obtain the necessary data.
Utilize the output to build a Tableau dashboard.
Analyze the dashboard to draw conclusions and identify potential enhancements to the checkout process.

# Second SQL Project
# Customer Engagement Analysis with SQL and Tableau Project
# Overview:
Welcome to the Customer Engagement Analysis project repository! This project provides a unique opportunity to enhance your professional portfolio by delving into the 365 platform's student engagement. Your task is to build a three-page dashboard using SQL and Tableau, showcasing key metrics and visualizations that address critical questions about student engagement with the 365 platform.

# Objective:
The main objectives of the dashboard are to answer the following questions:

1. Top Courses Analysis:

Identify the most-watched courses.
Explore the ratings of these courses.

2. Student Registration and Onboarding:
Track monthly student registrations.
Determine the fraction of registered students who are onboarded.

3. Engagement Metrics by Student Type:
Analyze how students on free plans versus paying students engage with the platform.
Compare total minutes watched and average minutes watched.

4. Temporal and Seasonal Engagement:
Investigate if student engagement with content increases over time.
Explore seasonal variations in student engagement.

5. International Engagement:

Identify countries with the most registered students.
Explore if engagement scales proportionally with the number of minutes watched per country.

# SQL Code:
The provided SQL code sets the foundation for the analysis. It covers the following steps:

Calculate Total Minutes Watched and Number of Students for Each Course: title_total_minutes
Calculate Average Minutes Watched for Each Course: title_average_minutes
Calculate Ratings for Each Course: title_rating
Create a View for Purchases Information: purchases_info
Retrieve Information on Student Engagement: engagement_metrics

# Instructions:
Execute the SQL code in your database environment to obtain the necessary data.
Utilize the output to build a Tableau dashboard that answers the specified questions.
Create three pages in your Tableau dashboard to present the insights coherently.
